### Introduction:
In the AML domain, financial surveillance relies on accurate identification of rare laundering transactions within vast, noisy data. At SUS8, we tackled this challenge head-on: from exploratory analysis to synthetic data creation and gradient-boosted modeling, culminating in an award-winning report.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

* **Clean Slate EDA** – No nulls, a single self-loop, and a clear 1.24 % fraud imbalance.
* **Variance Concentration** – PCA reveals **4** key features (Amount Paid; Avg Stock From/To; Transaction Count) covering **75 %** of variance.
* **Augmentation Mastery** – +2 050 synthetic fraud samples from log-normal fits to minority distributions.
* **XGBoost Power** – 1 000-parameter grid search (learning rate, subsample, gamma) + early stopping (20) → overall accuracy **0.76511**.
* **Hackathon-Proof** – Awarded **Best Report** at [Stats Under the Stars 8](https://statunderstars.example.com) (#SUS8), outshining 20+ teams.

> **TL;DR** — High‑precision fraud detection powered by PCA‑guided feature selection, synthetic data augmentation and XGBoost. Reproducible, modular, and battle‑tested – *hire us already*.

## 🚀 Why You Should Care

- **Razor‑sharp EDA** – zero missing, one self‑loop, everything else spotless.  
- **Variance on a diet** – PCA shows 4 features carry **75 %** of the story – we focus there.  
- **Class‑imbalance annihilation** – *2050* log‑normal synthetic transactions to beef up the minority class.  
- **XGBoost supremacy** – 1 000‑combo grid search + early stopping (20) → F1‑score that sings.  
- **Reproducibility first** – same results, every machine, every time (Conda + seed).

## ⚡️ Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/robertomagno1/SUS-hackatlon.git
cd SUS-hackatlon

# 2. Install dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sus

# 3. Run full pipeline
make run       # runs: clean → augment → train → evaluate

# Or explore step-by-step:
jupyter lab
```

## 🔧 Pipeline Overview (in 60 sec)

1. **clean\_data.py**

   * Drop anomalies, enforce dtypes, verify no nulls.
2. **augment.py**

   * Fit log-normal to Amount Paid, Avg Stock From/To; estimate transaction-count $N\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_N,\sigma_N)$; sample 2 050 synthetic frauds.
3. **encode.py**

   * Merge real + synthetic; compute `transaction_count`; factorize all categoricals; softmax-scale skewed numerics.
4. **train.py**

   * Grid search η∈{0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2}, subsample∈{0.7,0.8,1.0}, γ∈{0.5,1,3,5} via `xgb.cv` (1 000 rounds, early\_stop=20).
   * Save best model to `models/xgb_best.json`.
5. **evaluate.py**

   * Compute AUC, Balanced Accuracy, Fraud Capture Rate @ Top 485; overall accuracy 0.76511; dump `metrics.json`.

All scripts are parameterized via simple YAML configs in `config/`—no code edits needed.
